Reinforcement Learning is one of the most exciting types of Artificial Intelligence and the Unity ML-Agents project is one of the easiest and most fun ways to get started. 

This project is shows how to create intelligent flying hummingbirds that can navigate to flowers, dip their beaks in, and drink nectar. These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets. They have more complicated controls and their flight paths cannot be solved with traditional navigation systems. A training environment is crafterd and neural networks are trained to perform this challenging task, then a player can compete against the birds in a simple mini-game.
